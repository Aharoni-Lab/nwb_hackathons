## What should my workshop project look like?

Projects may span a broad range of topics, e.g., converting data to NWB, developing new features for PyNWB/MatNWB, exploring new problems, or creating documentation.

Design your project in a way that you can make significant progress during the workshop (i.e., in ~1-2 days). This also means that you should come prepared for the workshop. For example, if your project is about converting data to NWB, then you should know the data and ideally have scripts for reading the data in Python or MATLAB already working and prepared.

If you would like to collaborate with others in the workshop who are working on similar datasets or tool development, create a project page (see below) with an outline for your workshop project.

## How to create a new project page

When you are ready, create a new project page by creating a new `README.md` file in a new subfolder of the [projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK09_2020_Remote/projects) folder using the provided [project description template][project-description-template] and add your project to the project list in the [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md) file. Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project using GitHub are:

1. Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go to the [projects](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK09_2020_Remote/projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click the "Create new file" button (toward the top-right of the page)
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md` as the new file name. Your project name should not have any spaces.
1. Paste the previously copied content from the project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections
1. Click the "Propose new file" button
1. Click the "Create pull request" button to open a pull request
1. Click the "Create pull request" button. After an administrator reviews and merges your pull request, the workshop website will be updated.
