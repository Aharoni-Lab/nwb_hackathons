## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** September 21-23, 2020
- **Location:** Your home!

## Registration

The workshop is open to the public. Please complete our [registration form](https://bit.ly/2PHbE34) to attend the event. Anyone interested in NWB may request an invitation.

## Logistics

We will be using Zoom for the meeting. We will send an email the day before the workshop with Zoom links for each day.

It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer or phone. See installation instructions [here](https://zoom.us/download).

## Organizing Committee

**Program chairs:** Ryan Ly, Benjamin Dichter, Andrew Tritt, Pam Baker, and Oliver Rübel

Additional organizational support is provided by the Kavli Foundation

## Resources

Recorded talks will be uploaded after the talks are given.

## How to prepare?

Install the Python or MATLAB software for NWB:
  * PyNWB (Python): [https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html)
  * MatNWB (MATLAB): [https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwb/)

If you are new to NWB, we encourage you to prepare a dataset that you would like to convert to NWB so that you can try the tutorials and ask the developers questions during the workshop. You should know how to read the data using Python or MATLAB and ideally have scripts ready for reading the data.

If you would like to collaborate with others in the workshop who are working on similar datasets or tool development, we encourage you to create a project page with an outline for your workshop project. For further details and instructions on how to create a project, see [here](projects/README.md). We will advertise these projects during the workshop and check in with you each day.

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the NWB User Days user training workshop is to bring the experimental neurophysiology community together to further the adoption and development of NWB, the NWB software libraries, and scientific workflows that rely on NWB. Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB, share NWB-based tools, surface common needs, resolve coding issues, make feature requests, brainstorm about future collaboration, and make progress on current blockages. The event will also enable NWB developers and users to interact with each other to facilitate communication, gather requirements, and train users.
