## Dates and Location

- **Dates:** March 30 - April 1, 2021
- **Location:** Anywhere with an internet connection

## Overview

The workshop will focus primarily on developers, and will allow software developers in the NWB ecosystem to collaborate
 on NWB or DANDI-related projects.

## Registration

**Registration is not open yet. A link will be posted here when registration opens.**


## Logistics

We will be using the Zoom videoconferencing platform for the meeting. We will send an email in the days before the workshop with Zoom links.

It is possible to use Zoom from the browser, but we recommend you install the Zoom app on your computer or phone. See installation instructions [here](https://zoom.us/download).

## Organizing Committee

**Program chairs:** Ryan Ly, Benjamin Dichter, Andrew Tritt, Pam Baker, and Oliver Rübel

Additional organizational support is provided by the Kavli Foundation.

## Resources

Recorded talks will be uploaded after the talks are given.

## How to prepare?

## Objective

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology project (NWB, [https://www.nwb.org/](https://www.nwb.org/)) is an effort to standardize the description and storage of neurophysiology data and metadata. NWB enables data sharing and reuse and reduces the energy barrier to applying data analysis both within and across labs. Several laboratories, including the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have wholeheartedly adopted NWB. The community needs to join forces to achieve data standardization in neurophysiology.

The purpose of the NWB User Days training workshops is to bring the experimental neurophysiology community together to further the adoption and development of NWB, the NWB software libraries, and scientific workflows that rely on NWB. Members of the community will exchange ideas and best practices for using NWB, share NWB-based tools, surface common needs, resolve coding issues, make feature requests, brainstorm about future collaboration, and make progress on current blockages. The event will also enable NWB developers and users to interact with each other to facilitate communication, gather requirements, and train users.
